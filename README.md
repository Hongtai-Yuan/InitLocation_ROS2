# InitLocation_ROS2

This warehouse is based on the simulation of bilibili XJU mobile robot. If AMCL is used in navigation, an initial position needs to be given first. With the help of this warehouse, calibration can be carried out after the initial positioning is given to achieve more accurate positioning and correction.
